US Household income Data Exploration: Insights from American Community Survey

I explore a random sample of American households collected by the U.S. Census Bureau between 2015 and 2019 as part of the American Community Survey (ACS). In particular, I am going to use this data to measure household income inequality in the United States, then analyze how that income inequality might change under a range of different tax policies.

It first consists of describing main relevant statistics of the sample, such as min, max, mean income, standard deviation, and relevant percentiles, as well as representing a histogram of the data.

In the objective of reducing income inequality, five policies are introduced and the effect on the inequality is quantified. The goal is to evaluate whether the income inequality would be decreased, and which would be the best for it.
