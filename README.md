- âš¡ Fun fact: The word "hydrology," which relates to the study of water, comes from the Greek words "hydor," meaning water, and "logos," meaning study. Interestingly, ancient civilizations like the Greeks and Egyptians had their own early forms of hydrology. They used observations of the Nile River's floods to develop some of the earliest agricultural practices, highlighting how closely human survival has been tied to understanding water dynamics for thousands of years!
