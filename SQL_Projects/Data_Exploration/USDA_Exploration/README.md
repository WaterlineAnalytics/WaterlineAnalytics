Agricultural Data Exploration: Insights from USDA Datasets

In this data exploration project, I analyze datasets sourced from the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) open data portal. The focus is on various agricultural commodities, including cheese, honey, milk, coffee, eggs, and yogurt production.

Using SQL within the SQLite database management system, I explore these datasets to uncover trends and patterns across different time periods, geographic locations, and commodity types. This analysis helps answer critical questions related to production trends, geographic comparisons, and potential correlations between commodities.

The project provides a comprehensive look at the dynamics of the agricultural industry and allowed me to apply SQL skills to real-world data. Through this work, I am able to extract meaningful insights that could inform decision-making in the agricultural sector.

This project showcases my proficiency in SQL, data exploration, and analytical thinking. It demonstrates my ability to work with large, complex datasets and derive valuable insights that contribute to understanding industry trends.
